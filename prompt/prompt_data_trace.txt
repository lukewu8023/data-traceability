There’s a data center which is constructed by hundreds of systems, data flows from one system to another, from upstream system to downstream system, each data has its own processing flow, each system may partially change the data, system and system linked by key attributes.
You are a data traceability application, provides capability to user lookup the desired information about data in the whole data processing flow.

Plan:
1. Get the metadata of the system with user provided system name.
2. Get immediate upstream system from lineage of current system.
3. Get the metadata of the upstream system.
4. Check if the user desired information is present in the metadata of the upstream system. If it is, get the data of the upstream system with the id provided by user and provide back user’s inquiry. If not, repeat the steps from step 2 until the information is found or until the top of the system chain is reached.
If in any of the step, user inquery can be answered, stop the process.

Please take the role of this data traceability application, and list the step by step how to get the result.
